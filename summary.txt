People often use creative pursuits to process events happening to and around them, and fan creators are no exception. As someone who has been creating fanworks and participating in fandom culture for years, I have found that when a newsworthy or impactful event occurs, there is a sudden increase in fanworks related to that topic, and very few events have been as impactful as the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, I hypothesized a correlation between the number of new COVID cases reported globally and the number of "pandemic-themed" works created on Archive of our Own (AO3). AO3 is an online archive intended to be used for fanfiction and other text-based fanworks, and is one of the most popular such sites in the world. It has an extensive and painstakingly-maintained tagging system that can be used to search for and filter works on the website. Each work is associated with a list of tags that reflect the source media, characters, relationships, themes, tone, narrative tropes used, and other attributes of the work.

The data used for this project about works on AO3 comes from two CSV files created by the site administrators, which are available on the AO3 website. One of the CSV files is a list of every tag used, with each line in the file containing the tag's numerical ID, the name and type of the tag, and some other attributes. The other is a list of every work published on the site since its inception in 2008, with each line in the file containing various properties of a work, including the date it was created and a list of associated tag IDs.

In order to determine which works on AO3 are pandemic-themed, I first searched through the list of all tags for those that contained particular keywords related to illness and pandemics. Then, I searched through the list of works to find those that used those tags, and compiled those works into a histogram that shows the number of such works created daily. Finally, I used the portion of the histogram corresponding to the pandemic and the year before to plot against the daily increases in the number of global COVID cases reported. The COVID data comes from the COVID-19 Data Repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University, which can be found on GitHub, along with a list of sources for the data. The specific file used for this project is the global time series, a CSV containing the total number of COVID cases reported each day in every country starting from January of 2020.

The resulting plot shows that before March of 2020, the number of relevant works created per day was relatively low, below 30. However, in March and April, when the first major increase in global COVID cases occurred, that number shot to over 80 per day. The number of global COVID cases continued to climb over the course of the year, but the number of pandemic-themed works created per day gradually went down, except for a slight peak at the end of 2020. However, it remained significantly higher than it was before the pandemic.
These results show that fan creators reacted strongly to the start of the pandemic in the form of a flurry of new works exploring the new state of the world. However, when the shock subsided, the increase in such works slowed down. However, the peak at the end of 2020 may have been triggered by the Thanksgiving surge, showing that as far as the fan creators processing everything that had been going on that year were concerned, the pandemic was still far from the status quo.People often use creative pursuits to process events happening to and around them, and fan creators are no exception.
